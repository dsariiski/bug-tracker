# Bug Tracker

A simple bug-tracking app to serve as a middleware of sorts between users and developers.

## Installation:

To use - download and install all dependencies with npm or yarn in both the client and the server directories. Start your database, then run

```bash
node index
```

in the client folder. You should see a "server is listening on port:3001" message.

Then, run

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```
as per your preference in the client folder.

Next, go to http://localhost:3000 and the app should be running.

### Requirements:

* MongoDB[v4.2.1 with OpenSSL 1.1.1c]
* NodeJS
 
No experimental features were used so reasonably older versions(offering ES6 support) should be fine.

## Built With

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v13.5.0/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
